To do:  
======  
- Thread the downloader so that we can measure download speeds in real-time. This might as well be doable by importing a seperate library, 
like urlgrabber. Please keep in mind that I like the current UI with the colours and [ ]'s. It would be nice if we can keep them in the 
process.  
- Optimize the setup.py file: users should be able to install this application by just typing:  
```sudo python2.7 setup.py install```  
- Include dependency checks in this installation process  
- Create a small man page  
- Keep this application as small and simple as possible  
- Maybe add some command-line options, like:  
  * -s: secret mode: hides each file by putting a dot in front of it. Can be used with other title options.
  * -t: top-secret mode: creates a folder called bin/ (if not already existing) and puts the downloaded files in there. Can be used with other 
title options.
  * -v: verbose mode
  * -q: quiet mode
  * -h: 'print this help message and exit'
  * -f: 'no-frills': use a simpler UI without the [ ]'s and colours.
