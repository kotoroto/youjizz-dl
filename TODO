To do:  
======  
- Thread the downloader so that we can measure download speeds in real-time  
- Optimize the setup.py file: users should be able to install this application by just typing:
```sudo python2.7 setup.py install```  
- Include dependency checks in this installation process
- Create a small man page
- Keep this application as small and simple as possible
