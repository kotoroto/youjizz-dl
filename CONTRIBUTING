Contributing  
============  

Coding  
------  

Every help is welcome! I'm still a beginner with Python. If you think you can improve this application by changing/adding some code, feel free 
to branch it. I'll gladly merge it with the main branch. Just make sure everything you do is well-commented, so I can understand what you did.  

Packaging  
---------  
I don't know a lot about packaging. If you know how to package this program for Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSuSE or Arch, or want to do it yourself, 
please send me a message!
